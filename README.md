## ðŸš€ About Me

I design and build AI systems that blend LLMs, RAG pipelines, and speech interfaces to solve real-world problems. At the SIT Ã— NVIDIA Joint AI Center, I engineered AI tools that support NLP-driven education and dialogue:

- ðŸŽ“ LLM-powered summarization for *ForumAId*, reducing instructor workload by ~40%
- ðŸ’¬ Real-Time AI Debater using ASR â†’ LLM â†’ TTS with subâ€‘2s response latency
- ðŸ¤– RAG-based chatbot using LangChain and FAISS to boost factual accuracy by 30â€“50%

Iâ€™m currently building **Skillâ€‘Issue.AI**, a platform aimed at helping students tailor their resumes using locally hosted LLMs and RAG-based retrieval â€” ideal preparation for roles in LLM product development, AI risk, or conversational systems.
