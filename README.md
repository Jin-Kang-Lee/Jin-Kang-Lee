# 👋 Hi, I’m Jin Kang Lee

**AI Engineer (LLM / NLP) • Student at SIT | Research Intern @ SIT × NVIDIA AI Center • Singapore**

## 🚀 About Me

I design and build AI systems that blend LLMs, RAG pipelines, and speech interfaces to solve real-world problems. At the SIT × NVIDIA Joint AI Center, I engineered AI tools that support NLP-driven education and dialogue:

- 🎓 LLM-powered summarization for *ForumAId*, reducing instructor workload by ~40%
- 💬 Real-Time AI Debater using ASR → LLM → TTS with sub‑2s response latency
- 🤖 RAG-based chatbot using LangChain and FAISS to boost factual accuracy by 30–50%

I’m currently building **Skill‑Issue.AI**, a platform aimed at helping students tailor their resumes using locally hosted LLMs and RAG-based retrieval — ideal preparation for roles in LLM product development, AI risk, or conversational systems.
